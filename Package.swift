// VouchCore: the Swift SDK for the Vouch Protocol (#32).
//
// A thin, idiomatic layer over the UniFFI bindings to the canonical Rust core
// (`vouch-core`), so iOS and macOS verify credentials with the exact same bytes
// as every other platform. The native code ships as an XCFramework built by
// `build-xcframework.sh`; the generated UniFFI binding (`vouch_core.swift`)
// imports its `vouch_coreFFI` module.
